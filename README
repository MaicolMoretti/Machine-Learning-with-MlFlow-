Environmental_original.ipynb is a jupyter notebook file. In this file you can see some machine 
learning algorithms.

Environmental_original.csv is the initial DataSet.

Environmental_2colonne.csv is the same DataSet but with only 2 columns (it's not necessary)

In EdaProject.py there is the same code of the Environmental_original.ipynb  (with some changes and improvements). Is used to log the project in MLFlow.
