# Machine-Learning-with-MlFlow

Environmental_original.ipynb is a jupyter notebook file. 
In this file you can see some machine learning algorithms. 
(YOU MUST RUN THIS FILE WITH jupyter-notebook)

Environmental_original.csv is the initial DataSet.

Environmental_2colonne.csv is the same DataSet but with only 2 columns (it's not necessary)

In EdaProject.py there is the same code of the Environmental_original.ipynb  (with some changes and improvements). 
Is used to log the project in MLFlow.

MLflow is an open source platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and 
a central model registry. 
MLflow currently offers four components:

- MLflow Tracking 
Record and query experiments: code, data, config, and results

- MLflow Projects
Package data science code in a format to reproduce runs on any platform

-MLflow Models
Deploy machine learning models in diverse serving environments

-Model Registry
Store, annotate, discover, and manage models in a central repository
